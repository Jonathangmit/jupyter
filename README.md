The file in which the course work is contained is called 'Python function COUNT 1'

In the file there is the 4 pieces of work, the actual output code is marked using the following notation.

1.Count assignment code

2.Dice assignment code

3.NumPy random binomial assignment code

4.Simpson's paradox assignment code

Within the workbook, there are pieces of code that are there that I used to further my understanding or develop it (my understanding) to a point at which I could construct the code.

Each cell containing coursework can be run independently of the rest of the book (all required imports are made within that code block)
